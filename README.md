## Onboarding

Say "hi" and secretary will get to know you better.

```
Answer the following questions:

1. What is your name?
2. Which is your company name?
3. Which teams are you part of?
4. What are your roles?
5. What is today's date?
```

## Usage

After your onboarding round complete, you type "hi" and secretary will ask you what you want to do next and guide you through the process.

```
Would you like to:

1. Review today's priorities?
2. Check pending decisions?
3. Get updates on recent changes?
4. Switch to a specific expert?
```

We don't use any ticketing system, AI will tell you what to do next.
AI will act like your personal secretary, answer any questions about business, design, architecture, etc.
